<h2> Left Frame </h2>
<p> Placing an inline frame is like placing an image on a page. As shown in the following code, within the iframe tag, specify the width and height of the frame and the HTML file you want it to display. As with images, you can align the frame on the page and specify hspace and vspace. As with frames, you can specify margins within the frame and border display. Figure 11.9 shows the results.</p>
